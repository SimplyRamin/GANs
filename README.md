<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product-Screenshot](images/1.png)

### Overview

This repository contains a collection of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures implemented in Python using the PyTorch library. These implementations serve as educational resources for those interested in understanding and working with GANs.

### GAN Architectures Included

1. ***Conditional GAN (CGAN)***:

- Two variations of Conditional GANs are implemented, allowing for conditional image generation based on label information.

2. ***Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)***:

- A Deep Convolutional GAN is designed for generating high-quality images. It introduces convolutional layers for improved performance.

3. ***GAN with MNIST Dataset***:

- A basic GAN model is trained on the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digits.

4. ***Simple GAN for Number Generation***:

- A straightforward GAN architecture for generating numerical data, such as sequences of numbers.

5. ***InfoGAN (Information Maximizing GAN)***:

- An InfoGAN model that learns disentangled representations and allows for the control of specific attributes in generated images.

### Built With
